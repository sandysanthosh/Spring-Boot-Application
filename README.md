# Spring Boot Application PRD


```


Here is a checklist for a Spring Boot application before moving it to production:

Review and optimize the application configuration:

Ensure that the application configuration is optimized for production. This includes reviewing settings for the database connection, server settings, caching, logging, and security.

Perform thorough testing:

Perform thorough testing of the application to ensure that it is stable and error-free. This includes functional testing, load testing, and security testing.

Secure sensitive data:

Ensure that sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets are securely stored and not exposed in the application code or configuration files.

Monitor application performance:

Set up monitoring and alerting to track application performance and detect any issues. This includes monitoring CPU and memory usage, database performance, and network traffic.

Implement logging and error handling:

Implement robust logging and error handling to help diagnose and resolve issues in production.

Optimize the application for scalability:

Ensure that the application is designed to scale horizontally and vertically as the load on the application grows.

Implement backup and recovery procedures:

Implement backup and recovery procedures to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a failure or disaster.

Implement security best practices:

Implement security best practices such as using HTTPS, securing the server, and protecting sensitive data.

Ensure compatibility with production environment:

Ensure that the application is compatible with the production environment, including the operating system, application server, and database.

Document the deployment process:

Document the deployment process to ensure that it is repeatable and can be easily replicated in the event of a failure or disaster.

By following this checklist, you can ensure that your Spring Boot application is production-ready and can be deployed with confidence.
